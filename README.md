# Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge
This is a repository with my work and notes from the Udacity ML&AI Challenge sponsored by Facebook. I participated in this challenge in the summer of 2019.

The course is taught by [Mat Leonard](https://twitter.com/MatDrinksTea), the
head of Udacity's School of AI, and [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/),
the lead of OpenMined.org and researcher at DeepMind.

Two repositories that hold learning resources used in this course are:
- [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)
- [Udacity's Private AI](https://github.com/udacity/private-ai)

## Content
- [lesson 2](./lesson-2/) concerns an intro to PyTorch
- [lessons 3 to 6](./lesson-3-6) is on differential privacy and PATE analysis
- [lesson-7](./lesson-7) is on federated learning
- [lesson-8](./lesson-8) is on securing federated learning
- [lesson-9](./lesson-9) is on encrypting deep learning
